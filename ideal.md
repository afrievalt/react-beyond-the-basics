# Attributes of an ideal react component.

     In the ever-evolving world of web development, React has emerged as a powerful and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's unopinionated nature grants app developers the freedom to enter the ecosystem seamlessly, while providing library authors the flexibility to drive innovation.

     The downside is developers are quickly overwhelmed with choices and suffer [JavaScript fatigue](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-manage-javascript-fatigue/). The abundance of choices can overwhelm developers, causing them to focus on immediate needs without considering the long-term consequences. Many developers lack the confidence or political capitol to advocate for coding standards, paving the way for inconsistency and accumulating technical debt within the React application. What begins as a greenfield project can swiftly morph into a legacy burdened by soul-crushing technical debt.

     Building software is hard, anyone who tells you different is trying to sell you something. The establishment and strict adherence to coding standards act as a safeguard against the [technical debt trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2pS9hN2Fws), empowering developers to consistently provide value on a large scale, with agility and accuracy.

     Effective standards should not merely impose constraints; they should also serve as a compass, offering guidance on the art of crafting software correctly. Here is that compass.
